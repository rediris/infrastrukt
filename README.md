# Foundation, for WordPress

Foundation, for WordPress, is a blank starter theme with the exceptional capabilities of [ZURB's Foundation Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/).

## Features

Foundation, for WordPress, features everything ZURB's Foundation Framework and HTML5 Boilerplate have to offer, however, some changes have been made to tailer it to WordPress, these include:

* A ySlow score of 95 (in regards to 'Small Site or Blog')
* SEO features such as an optomised Google Analytics snippet, robots.txt and Schema.org attributes
* Beautiful, coda-style tooltips
* SlideDown, a simple way to incorporate sliding content
* Reveal for WordPress, a simple modal box by ZURB made to work in WordPress
* Orbit for WordPress, ZURB's image and content slider tailored for WordPress
* A function to provide Google's jQuery CDN over WordPress' local copy
* Failsafe jQuery, with a fallback to WordPress' local copy
