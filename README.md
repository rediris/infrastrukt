Infrastrukt is WordPress theme built on [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/), by [Zurb](http://zurb.com/).

Big props go to [drewsymo](http://github.com/drewsymo/) for his work on the [Foundation for WordPress](https://github.com/drewsymo/Foundation) theme. Infrastrukt was originally forked from the FWP repository.

Infrastrukt features a resource loader, which will allow you to either load your CSS & JS files locally or via CDN.
